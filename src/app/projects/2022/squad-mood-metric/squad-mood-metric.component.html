                    <p class="contribution-description">To accomplish this project, my primary objective was to devise a method for data collection and visualization on a Splunk dashboard. The procedure started with the biweekly compilation of information into an Excel document. After that, I used Postman once a week to submit this data to Splunk.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="contribution-description">The main challenge I had was modifying the data to satisfy the unique encapsulation requirements of the Splunk API before transmission. To start, I used Python to extract the data from Excel and save it as a CSV file. Then, I included further arguments that were necessary for the POST request. Additionally, before sending the data, I filtered the data so itâ€™s easier to manipulate on Splunk. This step was essential to guaranteeing that the data could be accessed as well as fulfilling the API criteria.</p>
